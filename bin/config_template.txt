#. The data file is a CSV where each line is of the form 
#.
#.     A, B, M, N, R, GAMMA
#.
#. where A,B is the charging dipole, M,N is measuring dipole, R is the resistance (=potential difference across M,N divided by current),
#. and GAMMA is the modified chargeability which is defined as GAMMA=ETA/(1-ETA) where ETA is conventional chargeability. GAMMA is more suitable
#. for inversion as its values are unbounded.
#.
#. If errors are given then the format is
#.
#.     A, B, M, N, R, RELERR_R, GAMMA, RELERR_GAMMA
#.
#. where RELERR_R is the relative error for R and RELERR_GAMMA is the relative error for GAMMA. 
#. For electric field inversion R is to be read as field intensity.

#. For an IP inversion the calculation can be split into the conductivity and chargeability part while 
#. the intermediate result is saved to a restart file to allow for a faster configuration of the chargeability
#. inversion. When inversion is running under MPI one restart file per rank is created. This sets the file name
#. for teh restart file:
